## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* **Node.js and npm/yarn:** Installed on your local machine (for building the frontend and local testing).
* **Git:** For version control and deploying to Vercel via a Git repository.
* **Vercel Account:** Sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/).
* **Vercel CLI (Optional but Recommended):** Install via `npm install -g vercel`.
* **Firebase Account:** Sign up at [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/).
* **Google Cloud Account & Gemini API Key:**
    * A Google Cloud Project where the Gemini API is enabled.
    * A Gemini API Key obtained from Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Console.

---

## 2. Firebase Setup

Your backend relies on Firebase Firestore for data storage and Firebase Storage for file uploads.

### 2.1. Create Firebase Project
1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  Click on "**Add project**" and follow the on-screen instructions to create a new Firebase project.
3.  Give your project a name (e.g., `csv-data-analyzer`).

### 2.2. Set up Firestore
1.  In your Firebase project console, navigate to **Firestore Database** (under Build).
2.  Click "**Create database**".
3.  Choose "**Start in production mode**" or "**Start in test mode**". For initial deployment, test mode is easier, but remember to secure your rules before going live for real users.
    * **Test Mode Rules (example - very permissive):**
        ```json
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            match /{document=**} {
              allow read, write: if true; // WARNING: Open access
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    * **Production Mode (example - more secure, adjust as needed, especially if you add user authentication):**
        ```json
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            // Allow backend (admin SDK) full access
            // For client-side access (if any), you'd add rules like:
            // match /analyses/{analysisId} {
            //   allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
            // }
            // For now, assuming backend handles all writes and sensitive reads.
            match /{document=**} {
              allow read, write: if false; // Default deny all client access
            }
          }
        }
        ```
        Your serverless functions will use the Admin SDK, which bypasses these rules. These rules primarily affect client-side access.
4.  Choose a Cloud Firestore location (e.g., `us-central`, `europe-west`). This cannot be changed later.

### 2.3. Set up Firebase Storage
1.  In your Firebase project console, navigate to **Storage** (under Build).
2.  Click "**Get started**".
3.  Follow the security rules setup. Similar to Firestore, start with test rules or implement more secure rules.
    * **Test Mode Rules (example - very permissive):**
        ```json
        rules_version = '2';
        service firebase.storage {
          match /b/{bucket}/o {
            match /{allPaths=**} {
              allow read, write: if true; // WARNING: Open access
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    * **Production Mode (example - more secure, adjust as needed):**
        ```json
        rules_version = '2';
        service firebase.storage {
          match /b/{bucket}/o {
            // Allow backend (admin SDK) full access via service account.
            // Example: Allow authenticated users to write to specific paths
            // match /raw_csvs/{userId}/{fileName} {
            //   allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
            // }
            // match /cleaned_csvs/{analysisId}/{fileName} {
            //   allow read: if true; // Or more restrictive
            // }
            match /{allPaths=**} {
              allow read, write: if false; // Default deny all client access
            }
          }
        }
        ```
4.  Note your **Storage bucket URL** (e.g., `your-project-id.appspot.com`). You'll need this for an environment variable.

### 2.4. Generate Service Account Key
Your backend serverless functions need a service account key to interact with Firebase services (Firestore, Storage) with admin privileges.
1.  In the Firebase console, go to **Project settings** (click the gear icon next to Project Overview).
2.  Select the **Service accounts** tab.
3.  Click on "**Generate new private key**" under "Firebase Admin SDK".
4.  A JSON file will be downloaded. **Keep this file secure!** Do not commit it to your Git repository.
5.  You will use the content of this JSON file for an environment variable in Vercel.

---

## 3. Backend Deployment (Vercel Serverless Functions)

Your backend API (Node.js functions in the `api/` directory) will be deployed to Vercel.

### 3.1. Project Setup on Vercel
1.  Push your project code (including the `api/` directory and frontend code) to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2.  Go to your Vercel dashboard.
3.  Click "**Add New...**" -> "**Project**".
4.  Import your Git repository. Vercel will usually auto-detect the framework (Node.js for the API functions).
5.  **Root Directory**: If your `api/` directory and `package.json` (for backend dependencies) are not at the root of the repository (e.g., if you have a monorepo structure like `packages/backend`), adjust the "Root Directory" setting in Vercel. For the current structure where `api/` is at the root alongside frontend `src/`, the root directory setting in Vercel should typically be the repository root.

### 3.2. Configure Environment Variables (Backend)
In your Vercel project settings (Settings -> Environment Variables):
* **`FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON`**:
    * Value: Paste the **entire JSON content** of the service account key file you downloaded from Firebase.
* **`FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET_URL`**:
    * Value: Your Firebase Storage bucket URL (e.g., `your-project-id.appspot.com`).
* **`GEMINI_API_KEY`**:
    * Value: Your Google Gemini API Key.

Ensure these variables are available for all environments (Production, Preview, Development).

### 3.3. Deploy Backend
* Once configured, Vercel will automatically build and deploy your project when you push changes to your connected Git repository's main branch (for production) or other branches (for preview deployments).
* You can also trigger a manual deployment from the Vercel dashboard or using the Vercel CLI (`vercel deploy --prod`).
* Your API endpoints (e.g., `/api/upload-and-preprocess-csv`) will be available at your Vercel deployment URL.

---

## 4. Frontend Deployment (Vercel React App)

Your React frontend will also be deployed by Vercel, typically from the same project if it's in the same repository.

### 4.1. Vercel Project Settings (Frontend)
Vercel is usually good at detecting Create React App setups.
1.  In your Vercel project settings, under "Build & Development Settings":
    * **Framework Preset**: Should be detected as "Create React App" or similar. If not, select it.
    * **Build Command**: Verify it's set correctly (e.g., `npm run build` or `yarn build` or `react-scripts build`). This should match your `package.json` scripts.
    * **Output Directory**: For Create React App, this is typically `build`. Verify this setting.
    * **Install Command**: `npm install` or `yarn install`.

### 4.2. Configure Environment Variables (Frontend) - If Any
* Your current frontend (`apiClient.js`) uses relative paths (`/api/...`) to call the backend. When deployed on Vercel, this setup works seamlessly because Vercel routes `/api/*` requests to your serverless functions in the `api/` directory from the same domain.
* If you were to use absolute URLs for the API (not recommended in this setup), you would set them here (e.g., `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`). For now, no frontend-specific environment variables related to the API base URL seem necessary.

### 4.3. Deploy Frontend
* Similar to the backend, pushes to your Git repository will trigger deployments.
* The frontend will be served from the root of your Vercel deployment URL.

---

## 5. Post-Deployment Testing

Once both frontend and backend are deployed:

1.  **Access your Vercel deployment URL** in a browser.
2.  **Test API Endpoints (Optional, using a tool like Postman or Insomnia):**
    * You can directly test your API endpoints (e.g., `https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app/api/analyses`) to ensure they are working before testing through the UI.
3.  **Test Frontend User Flows:**
    * **CSV Upload**: Upload a CSV file and provide an analysis name. Verify that the `upload-and-preprocess-csv` endpoint is called, data is processed, and an analysis record appears in Firestore and Storage.
    * **Initial Topic Analysis**: After upload, the dashboard should load. Verify `initiate-topic-analysis` is called and the initial analysis block is displayed.
    * **Chat Interaction**: Test sending messages in the chat. Verify `chat-on-topic` is called, responses are received, and new analysis blocks are generated.
    * **View Existing Analyses**: Navigate to "Moje Analizy" (or ensure the sidebar loads them). Select an existing analysis. Verify `getAnalysisTopicData` is called and the dashboard loads the correct data.
4.  **Check Firebase Console:**
    * Verify that new documents are created in Firestore (`analyses` collection, `topics` subcollection, `chatHistory` subcollection).
    * Verify that files are uploaded to Firebase Storage (`raw_csvs` and `cleaned_csvs` folders).
5.  **Check Vercel Logs:**
    * Monitor function logs in your Vercel project dashboard for any runtime errors in your serverless functions.

## 6. Custom Domain (Optional)

If you have a custom domain, you can configure it in your Vercel project settings (Settings -> Domains).

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Tips

* **Environment Variables Not Set:** Double-check that all required environment variables (`FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON`, `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET_URL`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`) are correctly set in Vercel for the appropriate environments. Ensure there are no typos.
* **Build Failures:** Check the build logs in Vercel for errors. Common issues include missing dependencies (ensure `package.json` is correct for both frontend and any backend-specific needs if they were separate) or incorrect build commands.
* **Function Errors (500 Internal Server Error):** Check the runtime logs for your serverless functions in the Vercel dashboard. This will provide details about exceptions occurring in your backend code.
* **CORS Issues:** Unlikely with Vercel's `/api` routing from the same domain, but if you ever separate frontend and backend hosting, you might need to configure CORS headers on your backend responses.
* **Firebase Rules:** If you encounter permission errors accessing Firestore or Storage, review your Firebase security rules. Remember that serverless functions using the Admin SDK bypass these rules, but any client-side attempts to access Firebase directly would be subject to them.
* **File Paths in Serverless Functions:** Ensure paths to helper modules (like `../_lib/firebaseAdmin.js`) are correct relative to the API function file.
* **`formidable` or File Upload Issues**: Ensure `bodyParser` is disabled for the file upload endpoint in Vercel config if you're using a library like `formidable`. Check temporary file permissions or cleanup if issues arise.
* **Gemini API Quotas/Billing**: If Gemini calls fail, check your Google Cloud project for API quotas and ensure billing is enabled.

#Implementation of CSV procesing

# Clarification on Backend File Structure and Design Document Alignment

This document addresses observations regarding the backend code generated for the "CSV Data Analyzer" project, specifically in comparison to the "CSV Data Analyzer: Backend Architecture & Design" document.

**Date:** May 23, 2025

## 1\. Context

During the backend code generation process, certain files were created that were not explicitly detailed as top-level API endpoint files in the "Backend Architecture & Design" document, and one suggested helper file was initially integrated elsewhere. This clarification explains the reasoning behind these decisions.

## 2\. Points of Clarification

### 2.1. Creation of `api/analyses.js` and `api/analyses/[analysisId]/topics/[topicId].js`

  * **Purpose:** These files were created to implement the `GET` API endpoints required by the frontend's `apiClient.js` module. Specifically:
      * `GET /api/analyses` (handled by `api/analyses.js`): This endpoint is called by `apiClient.getAnalysesList()` and is essential for fetching the list of all existing analyses. This functionality supports the "Moje Analizy" (My Analyses) feature in the frontend, allowing users to view and select their past work.
      * `GET /api/analyses/{analysisId}/topics/{topicId}` (handled by `api/analyses/[analysisId]/topics/[topicId].js`): This endpoint is called by `apiClient.getAnalysisTopicData()` and is used to fetch detailed data for a specific analysis and topic. This includes any initial analysis overview for that topic and the complete chat history. This is critical for the `Dashboard.js` component to load and display an existing analysis.
  * **Alignment with Documentation:**
      * The "CSV Data Analyzer: Backend Architecture & Design" document, in its primary "Vercel Serverless Functions (Node.js API Endpoints)" section (Section 4), focused on detailing the `POST` endpoints (`upload-and-preprocess-csv`, `initiate-topic-analysis`, `chat-on-topic`) which represent the core transactional logic.
      * However, the need for these `GET` endpoints was anticipated and highlighted in the "Frontend Migration Guide: Integrating with Backend Services." Section 3 of that guide, "Prerequisites: API Client Implementation (apiClient.js)," explicitly states the assumption and requirement for these `GET` endpoints for `apiClient.js` to fulfill its role in fetching data for the frontend. [cite: 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187]
      * Therefore, the creation of these `GET` endpoint files was a purposeful action to ensure full frontend functionality by providing the necessary data retrieval capabilities from the backend.

### 2.2. Non-Creation of a Separate `csvProgrammaticProcessor.js` File (Initially)

  * **Design Document Suggestion:** The "CSV Data Analyzer: Backend Architecture & Design" document (Section 4.7.6, Directory Structure) proposed `api/_lib/csvProgrammaticProcessor.js` for housing "Programmatic CSV cleaning logic." [cite: 477, 355] This is a standard best practice for modularity and maintainability, especially as data cleaning logic can become complex.
  * **Current Implementation Approach:** In the generated code for the `api/upload-and-preprocess-csv.js` endpoint, a simplified version of CSV preprocessing logic (e.g., header cleaning, basic row/column filtering using `papaparse`) was included directly within that endpoint's file.
  * **Reasoning and Intent:**
      * **Expediency for Initial Generation:** Including the initial, simplified cleaning logic directly within the `upload-and-preprocess-csv.js` endpoint allowed for a more self-contained and immediately functional example of that endpoint.
      * **Acknowledged Refactoring Option:** This was a practical first step. The design principle of having a separate processor is still valid and encouraged. Explicit comments were included in the generated `api/upload-and-preprocess-csv.js` code to highlight this:
          * `// --- CSV Processing Helper Functions (Simplified - consider moving to csvProgrammaticProcessor.js) ---`
          * And a note reinforcing that for more complex logic, refactoring into the dedicated module is ideal.
  * **Status:** The non-creation of `csvProgrammaticProcessor.js` as a separate file *at this stage of code generation* was an interim step. The recommendation remains to refactor the `preprocessCsvData` function and any more sophisticated CSV cleaning logic into the planned `api/_lib/csvProgrammaticProcessor.js` module. This would enhance code organization, testability, and reusability as the project evolves.

## 3\. Conclusion

The adjustments made during backend code generation—adding necessary `GET` endpoints and provisionally integrating CSV processing logic—were intentional decisions aimed at providing a complete and functional set of backend services that align with the frontend's requirements as detailed in the migration guide. The original design principles, such as modularizing CSV processing, remain valid and are recommended for future refinement of the codebase.
